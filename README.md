Project done by Mathew Lagat, student in Kabarak University pursuing Bachelor 
of Science in Information Technology 3rd year.
In the current world, people are in need of delivery services to 
their door step so that people don't strain going to 
pick the items they order online from far distance. 

This project is an android and iOS application created with dart/flutter which helps
customers order items from a particular shop with delivery services and the items
are delivered to the immediately or letter 
depending on the services of that shop that implements the use of this app.

The added advantage of this app over other similar applications that exist is that this app 
enables the customer to track the items after placing an order. When the delivery is started, 
the customer 
can track where the items are in real time, they can be able to see this on a map. When the items
are on the delivery point, the delivery person gets a pop up with the customer details so that he/she can
call the customer, the customer also gets a notification telling them that their items have arrived and 
need to be picked.

The company manager assigns the delivery jobs to the delivery people, when the delivery person is assigned a
delivery task, he/she gets a notification in real time and he/she should start the delivery at that 
time if possible, 
when the delivery person starts the delivery on his application UI the customer gets a notification.

The customer also pays for the items online before the delivery. The app has several payment methods 
implemented including
paypal.

If this app is implemented, it would make the work of a delivery company very easy. 
The application is still being improved and added some other features and corrections.
